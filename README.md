# 🌾 Predicting Crop Production Based on Agricultural Data

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict **crop production (in tons)** using regression models based on features like **area harvested (in hectares)**, **yield (in kg/ha)**, and **year**. Accurate predictions can assist in planning, policy-making, and optimizing agricultural operations.

## 🧠 Skills Gained

* Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data Visualization
* SQL
* Machine Learning (Regression)
* Streamlit App Development

## 🌍 Domain

**Agriculture**

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Agriculture is vital to the economy. Accurate crop production forecasts are essential for food security, planning, and policy-making. This project builds a regression-based predictive model using agricultural data.

## 💼 Business Use Cases

* **Food Security & Planning**: Help governments and NGOs prepare for demand.
* **Policy Development**: Inform agricultural subsidies, insurance, and relief efforts.
* **Supply Chain Optimization**: Improve logistics for agribusinesses.
* **Market Price Forecasting**: Assist farmers and traders in market planning.
* **Precision Farming**: Guide crop selection and resource usage.
* **Agri-Tech Tools**: Support development of smart farming solutions.

## 🤉 Project Approach

### 1. Data Preprocessing

* Handle missing values
* Standardize metrics and filter relevant features

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyze crop and region distributions
* Identify trends over time
* Study correlations between yield, area, and production
* Detect outliers and anomalies

### 3. Predictive Modeling

* Train regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)
* Predict total **crop production** based on input features
* Evaluate model performance using metrics like R², MAE, RMSE

### 4. Streamlit Web App

* Interactive app for real-time crop production prediction
* User inputs: crop, region, area, yield, year
* Output: predicted production value

## ✅ Outcomes

* Discover trends in crop yield and productivity
* Build accurate models for production forecasting
* Provide actionable insights for agriculture planning
* Deliver a user-friendly interface via Streamlit
